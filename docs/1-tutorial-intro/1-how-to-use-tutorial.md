# How to use this tutorial

### Welcome to the HLA Tutorial. 

This tutorial covers everything from an overview of what HLA is used for, to the practical design and development of HLA based systems. 

Here is a short guide for the reader:
- If you want a quick overview of what HLA is all about you can start with reading this first chapter.
- If you want to understand the technical architecture of HLA, also read chapter two and three about the architecture and services of HLA.
- If you intend to understand how to develop HLA based systems then continue with the rest of the tutorial.

This tutorial is available as a stand-alone document or as part of the HLA Evolved Starter Kit. This kit contains software and samples with source code that you can run on your own computer, study, experiment with, extend or even use as a starting point for your own HLA development. This document contains instructions about practical labs that you can perform for many of the chapters.

This document is based on the latest version of HLA commonly called HLA Evolved with the formal name IEEE 1516-2010. HLA Evolved builds upon earlier HLA versions such as HLA 1516-2000 and HLA 1.3.
