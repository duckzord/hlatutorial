# About

### Foreword

![Björn Möller](./img/bjorn_moller_profile.png)

“The High-Level Architecture is a powerful technology for developing distributed simulations. It is amazing to see how people use it to make simulations work together in many different domains, to create simulations that have never been created before.

I have been involved in the HLA community since the mid 90’s both in the standards development and the user community. I have also given at least one hundred HLA courses and seminars on four continents. With this document I want to offer everyone a practical introduction to HLA, based on these experiences.

This tutorial is mainly targeted at developers. I have written the tutorial as a small story where you can follow how an HLA federation is developed, step-by- step. It is intended to complement the HLA standard, which provides the final and complete specification of HLA.

I would also like to encourage the reader to become part of the HLA community through SISO, colleagues, numerous simulation conferences, papers, and of course the Internet. Enjoy the reading!”
