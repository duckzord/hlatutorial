# Summary

:::tip Main Points

- A typical FOM contains an identification table, object classes, Interaction classes, and data types.
- The identification table describes things like the purpose, author and, version of a FOM
- Interactions with parameters are described in a class tree
- Objects with attributes are described in a class tree
- A predefined FOM module called the MIM contains standard data types like HLAunicodeString
- For enumerated values like the FuelType we use an Enumerated Data Type 
- For complex data types, like a position with Lat and Long we use an HLAfixedRecord data type.
- For integers and floats we need to create Simple Data Types
