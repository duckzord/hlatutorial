# Who uses HLA?

### Use Cases

Two of the most common use cases for HLA are:
- Training, where humans are trained to perform tasks
- Analysis, where we can try different scenarios in a simulated world.

Other use cases include test, engineering, and concept development.

HLA was originally developed for defense applications. This is still an important use case for HLA. Examples include training several pilots in flight simulators in motor skills, decision skills, and communications. Another area is command-level training where officers are trained to manage complex situations and command thousands of simulated participants. HLA enables this training to be joint (between Army, Navy, and Air Force) and combined (for example between Navies from different nations).

Training for peace support operations is a related area where defense units can train operations together with police, fire fighters, and non-government organizations such as the Red Cross.

Like many other technologies, originally developed in the defense area, there is a growing civilian user base of HLA. One example is space applications where complex missions, possibly taking months and years, can be simulated in a shorter time and emergency situations can be trained without any real risk. HLA has also been used for space mission control training, such as the docking of automated transfer vehicles with the International Space Station.

Another area is Air Traffic Management where new procedures can be developed, evaluated and trained using a number of interoperable simulations.

Yet other areas include manufacturing, offshore oil production, national railroad systems, medical simulations, environment, and hydrology.
