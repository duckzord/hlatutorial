# What is the HLA?

### HLA is about Interoperability and Reuse

The High-Level Architecture, HLA, is an architecture that enables several simulation systems to work together. This is called interoperability, a term that covers more than just sending and receiving data. The systems need to work together in such a way that they can achieve an overarching goal by exchanging services.

Why do we need to connect several simulation systems? One reason is that an organization may already have a number of simulation systems that need to be used together with newly acquired simulations or simulations from other organizations. Another reason is that there may be a requirement to simulate a “bigger picture”, where models from different organizations interact. Experts from different fields need to contribute different models. In many cases it would also be a monumental task to build one big system that covers everything compared to connecting several different simulations.

One important principle of HLA is to create a **federation** of systems. Most simulation systems are highly useful on their own. With HLA, we can combine them to simulate more complex scenarios and chains of events. HLA enables us to reuse different systems in new combinations.

The two main merits of HLA are thus interoperability and reuse.
