# Getting started with the Lab

The labs do note require any programming. They can be carried out by anyone with a reasonable computer experience.

This chapter provides the following lab instructions

1. A first test drive of the federation.
2. Connect, Create and Join.
3. Developing a FOM for Interactions
4. Sending and receiving interactions
5. Developing a FOM for objects
6. Registering and discovering object instances
7. Updating objects
8. Running a distributed federation

## Installing the HLA Evolved Starter Kit
Before you try any of the labs you need to run the installer for the HLA Evolved Starter Kit. Advanced: Programmers may choose to modify and extend the code of these federates after completing the above labs. In such case you need to install the suggested development environments, which are:

|Platform|Language|Environment|
|--------|--------|-----------|
|Windows|C++|Visual C++ 10.0 Express or full version|
|Linux|C++|gcc 4.1 or later|
|Windows & Linux|Java|Intellij Community Edition + JDK 1.6|

The installation kit contains the following files that are helpful when modifying the code:
- For C++ there are Visual Studio VC10 project files and Make files (32 bit)
- For Java there are IntelliJ project files and Ant build files.

Note that the installation kit contains a ReadMe file with additional technical information.

## Support
Community support is available for the HLA Tutorial and the sample federates as follows:

1. Go to www.stackoverflow.com
2. Use the tag HLAstarterkit

There is no commercial support for the HLA Tutorial or the sample federates.
