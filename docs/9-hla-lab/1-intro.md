# Lab 1: A First Test Run

In the first lab we will install, start up and run the federation.
## Installation
If you don’t already have any Pitch software installed then download and install the following software in the following order:
1. Pitch pRTI Free
2. Pitch Visual OMT Free
3. HLA Evolved Starter Kit
If you already have a commercial version of Pitch pRTI (version 4.4 or higher) installed then don’t install Pitch pRTI Free. You should then run the samples using your commercial product. Note that Pitch pRTI Free only allows for two federates at the same time, except when running the Fuel Economy Federation and the Restaurant Federation. 

If you already have a commercial version of Pitch Visual OMT (version 2.2 or higher) installed then don’t install Pitch Visual OMT Free. You should then run the samples using your commercial product.

## Starting up the federation
On the Start Menu, locate the following items:
- Pitch pRTI Free -> Pitch pRTI Free
- Fuel Economy-> Master
- Fuel Economy-> CarSimJ
- Fuel Economy-> CarSimC
- Fuel Economy-> MapViewer

To start the federation:

1. Start Pitch pRTI Free
2. Start all of the above federates in any order. Look in the pRTI Window. You should see federates appearing.
3. In the Master window: select a scenario using the menu
4. In the Master window: give the start command
5. In the MapViewer window, watch the cars move
6. Terminate the applications when you are done
