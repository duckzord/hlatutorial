# Overview

In part two we will develop an even more interoperable, flexible and reusable architecture for the Fuel Economy Federation and solve several issues that were identified in part one. Several of the Appendices from part 1 are available in an extended form in this part 2, in particular

- The Federation Agreement in Appendix A has been extended.
- The FOM in Appendix B has been extended and split into two parts.
- The Federate descriptions in Appendix C has been extended 

You are strongly recommended to refer to these Appendices when reading the main text of the tutorial, in particular Appendices A and B.

The first part provided detailed code examples. This second part assumes that you are up to speed with writing code that calls the HLA services. In many cases the calls are straightforward and detailed code examples are not provided. Instead there is an increased focus on federation design, best practices and a holistic view of the federation.
