# Summary

:::tip Main Points

- Synchronization points are used to synchronize the entire federation in one well defined state
- Typical use cases are to synchronize start-up of a federation or parts of a scenario
- It is recommended that a federate achieves all synchronization points that it has no knowledge about, in order not to stop the federation.
- You may consider using synchronization points or user-defined interactions to synchronize a federation. The former are stricter whereas the latter can be designed to be more flexible or forgiving.
