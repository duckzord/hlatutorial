# 4.1.	Introduction to Synchronization Points
In part one of the tutorial we used a sequence of interactions to start up the federation. First we selected the scenario and made sure that all federates had successfully loaded it. We then used interactions to start and stop the execution. An alternative is to use synchronization points. They allow us to ensure that all federates in the federation have reached a certain state. They also allow us to pause the federation in a controlled way.
