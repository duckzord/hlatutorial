# Thereâ€™s more to HLA Time Management

By now the basics of HLA Time Management has been covered for a straightforward federation. There are many additional features, which build upon these basics. These will be covered in a later chapter. Some examples are:

- Asymmetric time regulating/constrained federations, where not all federates may be regulating or constrained.
- Joining late into a time managed federation where federates have already been granted to a logical time greater than zero.
- Event-driven time management, where we advance time to the next event instead of the next time
- Zero lookahead where federates exchange messages for the current logical time instead of at a higher time
