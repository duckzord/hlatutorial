# About

### Foreword

![Björn Möller](../img/bjorn_moller_profile.png)

“Welcome back! In part one of the tutorial we took you on a guided tour of the core parts or HLA; the parts that you will use in more or less every federation.

It is now time to look at the more powerful features that make HLA a really unique architecture for simulation interoperability. You may consider this a smorgasbord where you can select any combination of features for your simulation needs. Because of the variety of use cases and solutions, plenty of discussion is provided after each example.

Do not distribute this draft yet!”

-Björn Möller
