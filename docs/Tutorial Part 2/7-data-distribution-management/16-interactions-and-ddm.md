# Interactions and DDM

DDM for interactions follows the same principles as object attributes. There are some minor differences:

1.	For object instances you associate the DDM regions to the attributes. All Update Attribute Values service calls will then use those regions. For interactions you need to provide the DDM regions each time you send them. The Send Interaction with Regions service is used for this.
2.	There is no DDM in and out of scope handling for interactions.
